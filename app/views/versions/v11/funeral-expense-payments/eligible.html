<p>The caller is potentially eligible if they:
<ul class="govuk-list--bullet govuk-list">
  <li>get certain benefits or tax credits</li>
  <li>are arranging the funeral and it's in the UK</li>
  <li>were a spouse or partner of the person who died</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What they could get</h2>
<p>They may get help to pay for:
  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet govuk-list">
    <li>burial or cremation fees</li>
    <li>death certificates and other documents</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>They could get up to £700 to pay for other funeral costs such as the coffin, flowers and funeral director’s fees.</p>

<p>There’s no fixed amount that they can get. It’s based on individual circumstances.
It will not cover the full cost of the funeral.</p>
